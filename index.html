       <div class="h6"><p></p>I began my HTML journey on freeCodeCamp as an initiative to enhance our HTML skills independently, a task assigned by our lecturer. Initially, it was enjoyable and motivating, but the pressure to complete the tasks within a strict timeline soon made it overwhelming. For many of us, including myself, the workload felt excessive, especially since we had other courses to manage as well. Despite the challenges, I understand that our lecturer has our best interests at heart, and that thought keeps me moving forward—for now. However, I wish he could ease up on the deadlines, as the pressure makes me focus on simply completing the tasks rather than truly improving my web development skills. I just hope that, even with the rush, I’ll be able to retain and apply what I’ve learned. Over the past month, my journey in web development has followed a similar pattern. My HTML learning experience on freeCodeCamp started off as a way to sharpen my skills but became increasingly stressful due to time constraints. Many of us felt frustrated trying to balance this work with other academic commitments. While I appreciate our lecturer’s intent to push us toward success, I can’t help but feel that the pressure sometimes detracts from the learning process. My main hope is that, even in the midst of rushing to meet deadlines, I’ll manage to remember and build on everything I’ve learned.
        I understand that our lecturer genuinely wants the best for us, and that motivates me to keep going. However, I wish he could reduce the pressure, as it makes me focus solely on completing the tasks on freeCodeCamp rather than truly improving my web development skills. I hope that despite the rush to meet deadlines, I’ll be able to retain everything I’ve learned.</p></div>
